## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character accesses a 'borrowed' memory so vivid they act on it as if it were their own, with unforeseen consequences.
- Create a dialogue between two neural-linked characters arguing over the ownership of a jointly-created memory.
- Describe the moment a 'Digital Native' discovers a memory in their archive they are certain is not theirs.
- Write a monologue from the perspective of an older generation character observing the Dialogues, grappling with a fundamentally changed concept of privacy and self.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative UI/UX for a 'memory cleaning suite' that allows users to visualize and edit emotional metadata from neural captures.
- Propose a protocol or 'ethical API' for a Dialogue system that defines layers of consent and permissions for memory sharing between linked minds.
